Normalizing ratings can have several advantages and disadvantages compared to using the actual ratings:

Advantages:
Normalized ratings allow for fairer comparisons between movies or users, as they account for differences in rating scales and biases in individual users.
Normalized ratings can be more informative than actual ratings, as they highlight the relative strengths and weaknesses of each movie or user within the context of the group.
Normalized ratings can help identify outliers or extreme ratings that may be skewing the results, by placing them in the context of the user's average rating and standard deviation.

Disadvantages:
Normalized ratings may obscure important individual differences in preferences or tastes, as they assume a certain level of conformity or similarity between users.
Normalized ratings can be sensitive to the distribution and size of the sample, as they are calculated based on the mean and standard deviation of the ratings within the group.
Normalized ratings may not be intuitive or easy to interpret for all users, as they require some understanding of statistical concepts such as standard deviation and z-scores.

Overall, using normalized ratings can be a useful tool for analyzing and comparing ratings data, especially when dealing with large and diverse groups of users. However, it is important to use them in conjunction with actual ratings and qualitative feedback, in order to gain a more complete understanding of users' preferences and opinions.
